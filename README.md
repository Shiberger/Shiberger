### About
I am a versatile technology professional with expertise spanning data analytics and iOS development. With a strong foundation in Swift development and data science, I bring a unique perspective to projects by combining analytical rigor with intuitive user experience design.

My approach to problem-solving is domain-driven, focusing first on understanding the business needs before developing technical solutions.
